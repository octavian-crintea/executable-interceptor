Simple application that injects a given interceptor into an ELF32
executable.

In order to use this script you have to download the pyelftools
library[1] and put it into the PYTHONPATH environment variable.

Usage: ./elf32_injector <elf32-file> <intcerp-file>

where elf32-file is the executable file and intcerp-file contains the
binary code to be used as interceptor.

As an example, you can use the code from the test directory that prints to
stdout the intercepted function's ID via a write syscall.  The output is in
binary form, so a good idea would be to redirect it to a tool like hexdump.
